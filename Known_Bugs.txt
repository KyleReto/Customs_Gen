I feel like this is a good place for us to communicate about bugs if they occur


For now, in my automator, I am creating a revert box on exceed pictures.
What determines if an exceed revert box exists?

Also, I noticed that special generation now uses the character picture selected,
even if there is a different art for specials chosen. Can you verify that the template manager
is still drawing special/ultra art from the json?
