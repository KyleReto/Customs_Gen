Not so much "bugs", but things that should probably be changed in future:

Some elements of the program have card types ("Special", "Ultra", etc) hardcoded, 
 but each template should be able to define any card type it wants,
 and the rest of the program should adapt accordingly.

Related to the above, card art is pulled by specific keys (one image for "character_image",
 one for "exceed_image", etc). We should probably rework the structure of config.json to allow
 the user to define one piece of card art for each card in the csv. For example, Petersonian's
 Amaterasu custom has 3 character cards and 3 exceed cards.
