I feel like this is a good place for us to communicate about bugs if they occur


For now, in my automator, I am creating a revert box on exceed pictures.
 What determines if an exceed revert box exists?
    An exceed revert box should be displayed if the exceed side card object has a truthy value for its cost, 
     which should be how the SF template handles it (but it may be bugged, I haven't thoroughly tested it)

Also, I noticed that special generation now uses the character picture selected,
 even if there is a different art for specials chosen. Can you verify that the template manager
 is still drawing special/ultra art from the json?
    Should be fixed now, though the solution is pretty messy.





Not so much "bugs", but things that should probably be changed in future:

Some elements of the program have card types ("Special", "Ultra", etc) hardcoded, 
 but each template should be able to define any card type it wants,
 and the rest of the program should adapt accordingly.

Currently, data is pulled from the config file according to various hardcoded keys.
 I'd like the templateinfo file to define these keys, rather than being hardcoded,
 and have the GUI adapt to allow the end user to define each of the required elements.
 This would be pretty tricky though, probably more of a "if we have time" sort of thing.

Related to the above, card art is pulled by specific keys (one image for "character_image",
 one for "exceed_image", etc). We should probably rework the structure of config.json to allow
 the user to define one piece of card art for each card in the csv. For example, Petersonian's
 Amaterasu custom has 3 character cards and 3 exceed cards.
